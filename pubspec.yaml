#此属性表示包名（package name），此属性是非常重要的，引入其他文件时需要使用此包名：import 'package:flutter_app/xxx.dart',也作为插件的名字
description: A new Flutter project.
# name 改了名字
# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev
# 不公开的私人包

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# 定义app的版本号+build次数
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# version: 2.3.3+13
version: 1.0.0+2
#所以只有后面的才有用 内部版本控制code
#版本设置 = app的VersionName + build次数，可以显示出来的
# 在 Android 中 version number 对应 versionName，build number 对应 versionCode，在 android/build.gradle 下有相关配置
#在手机上显示 只第二级也改变 才会显示高版本，高版本发布之后，就不能再下载低版本了，所以谨慎添加
#build次数没啥影响
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.17.0 <3.0.0"
  #Environment 属性下添加 Flutter 和 Dart 版本控制。

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.
# dependencies 和 dev_dependencies 下包含应用程序所依赖的包，
# dependencies 和 dev_dependencies 就像其名字一样，dependencies 下的所有依赖会编译到项目中，
# 而 dev_dependencies 仅仅是运行期间的包，比如自动生成代码的库。

  assets:
    - assets/questionnaires/
    - assets/images/
    # - assets/images/Splash_qehsnew.png
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
